```
$pip install virtualenv
```
Go into the app package and:
```
$ cd property_management_api
$ virtualenv venv
```
Activate the env by running the script 'activate':
```
$ venv\Script\activate
```

Then install all the required packages, they will only be installed into the python virtual env
```
$pip install flask
$pip install flask_sqlalchemy
$pip install flask_marshmallow
$pip install marshmallow-sqlalchemy
$pip install unidecode
```

## App setup:

1-In console into the app package: 
$python run.py

It sets up the API and the SQLite DB

2- Test in your browser:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/users
``` 
```
http://localhost:5000/api/properties
```
You should not get any error message.
